# Dynatrace Android Instrumentation Tutorial
___

## About this Mobile App
<p>This demo app is intended as an example Android Mobile Application to be instrumented with Dynatrace<br>
This readme file provides a basic tutorial with steps to instrument this app yourself as well as a general
overview of the application flow and code itself.<br><br>
The application itself is relatively simple but still includes functionality that would be typical
to find within a normal mobile application and serves as examples that are set up to be instrumented
with the Dynatrace Android Gradle Plugin or via Manual Instrumentation with the SDK directly<br><br>
Any and all feedback is appreciated just email me at Paul.Friesen@dynatrace.com and include the text
**Getting Groovy with Android Mobile Monitoring** in the subject</p>
